## About SkinDiagnosticAI
Skin  Diagnostic AI is an open source project created to develop application for medical specialists that will help identifying potential skin cancer with camera low cost devices, and collect dermatoscopic images for medical community. It will also help to patients to store their images in easy and accessible way on their personal devices, and potentiall provide fast diagnosis, with the risk of cancer estimated based on available images. Furthermore, the application shoudl allow, collecting, clustering and storing mutlitple images from the same patient, thus allowing for faster, and more speciffic patient-doctor interaction.

## About the project
###Â Feasibility study 
The goals of the that study were as follow: 
* __Step 1.__ To compare large number of AI models, with different diagnostic purposes using open source data from __Harvard database__
  - to identify main challenges with the dataset used for model training (HAM10000, from Harvard dataverse)       
  - to explore different strategies for data preparation, treatment and feature extraction,
  - to test, of the shelf AI solutions, with extensive grid search, 
  - to develope baseline for further analyses,    
  - to evaluate what statistics and error fucntions should be used for developing final, and ensemble models,
  - to compare different methods for results presentation that are most usefull for medical experts and non-medical users
* __Step 2.__ to evaluate __business value proposition__ of different models, and consult them with users and domain experts 
* __Step 3.__ __to deploy the pipeline__ with selected models on the cloud, and use it as __Proof of Concept__ produc, that can be used to generate actionable results, 
* __Step 4.__ to perform __AI readiness assesment__, and to collect requirement for potential MVP

> The notebooks, and software presented in this repository were used to conduct Step 1, of the SkinDiagnosticAI feasibility study. The slides attached below the text show selected results from all steps, including step 2-4"

## About PyClass
PyClass is an open-sourse, AI workbench for development of classyficaiton models for medical images. It allows for fast, EDA, automated comparison and selection of large number of models, feature extreaction networks, and image classyfication schemas. The piepline, uses only basic, python libraries, such as scipy, tensofrflow, and matplolib, and can be used with python 3.6-3.8. PyClass has be also used for Swissroads project https://github.com/PawelRosikiewicz/Swissroads



Comparison of 5000 AI methods for cancer detection and classyfication on dermatoscopic images from Harvard HAM10000 dataset using FastClassAI workbench 


## Presentation on SkinDiagnosticAI Project
* all images were created wiht PyClass AI workbech
* the slides shows full analyis done on over 5000 compared models and data treatment procedures, 
* Jupyter notebooks in notebook/ folder shows light vervion of that analyis that can be reapeated by the user and build up to any number of compared models,
