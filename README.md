Comparison of 5000 AI methods for cancer detection and classyfication on dermatoscopic images from Harvard HAM10000 dataset using FastClassAI workbench   

## About SkinDiagnosticAI
Skin  Diagnostic AI is an open source projects created to develop application for medical specialists that will help identifying potential skin cancer, and collect dermatoscopic images for medical community. It will also hep to patients to store their images in easy and accessible way on personal devices.

## About the project
Here, I present feasibility study done for SkinDiagnosticAI. 
The goals of the that study were as follow: 
* __Step 1.__ To compare AI models with different diagnostic purposes using open source data from __Harvard database__
  * speciffic goals presented in the n otebooks were as follow:
  - to identify main challenges with the dataset used for model training (HAM10000, from Harvard dataverse)       
  - to explore different strategies for data preparation, treatment and feature extraction,
  - to test, of the shelf AI solutions, with extensive grid search, 
  - to develope baseline for further analyses,    
  - to evaluate what statistics and error fucntions should be used for developing final, and ensemble models,
  - to compare different methods for results presentation that are most usefull for medical experts and non-medical users
* __Step 2.__ to define data pre-processing steps necessary for fast and accurate identification of different classes of skin cancer
* __Step 3.__ to evaluate __business value proposition__ of different models
* __Step 4.__ to perform __AI readiness assesment__, and consult the results with domain experts, in order to collect requirementst for MVP 


## Presentation on SkinDiagnosticAI Project
* all images were created wiht PyClass AI workbech
* the slides shows full analyis done on over 5000 compared models and data treatment procedures, 
* Jupyter notebooks in notebook/ folder shows light vervion of that analyis that can be reapeated by the user and build up to any number of compared models,
