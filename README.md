# SkinAnaliticAI - Skin Cancer Detection Using Harvard HAM10000 Dataset 
## Comparison of 5000 AI methods for cancer detection and classyfication on dermatoscopic images from Harvard HAM10000 dataset using FastClassAI workbench

In this Project I am testing first part of the FastClassAI workbench with HAM 10000 dataset of dermatoscopic images.  The goal is to quickly test and optimize large number of ml and deep learning models wiht different dataset cleaing and organisation protocols, in order to:    
- identify main challenges wiht the dataset,      
- explore potential strategies for data preparation, treatment and feature extraction,       
- test, of the shelf solutions, that may work, 
- develope baseline for further analyses,    
- evaluate what statistics and error fucntions shodul be used for developing final and ensemble models,
